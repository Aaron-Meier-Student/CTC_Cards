# CTC Trading Cards

A fun card pulling game like pokemon cards!

This branch is a complete rewrite of the entire site. This rewrite will included documentation in comments in most areas of the code to make it easier for others to understand. I will also be including a component based system for rendering and handling frontend objects on the page. A low security anti-cheat will also be included to prevent users from giving themselved cards they shouldn't have. Unobtainable cards will have its own system and can only be handed out by admins, these cards cannot be sold, traded, or modified.

Trading will pose a unique challenge, as github only allows you to host static pages. The security on the first version of trading will most likely be non-existant, allowing users to give other people cards they actually dont have.
